**Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes**

* Streamlined data-streaming applications for workforce management using Kotlin and Spring Boot.
* Optimized Apache Kafka event consumption, reducing the Data Store teamâ€™s storage requirements by 45%.
* Managed production deployments using Kubernetes for orchestration and Docker for containerization.
* Developed 50+ test cases for the job history application using TestRails and Kotlin after reaching out to clients.
* Streamlined error identification by writing Kibana log search aggregations for internal developer use.

This was my first experience in the industry so I set out to learn as much as I can during my time at UKG. I acted as a full-time developer in the Data Source team, working on tickets as they came through for each sprint. I began by making changes to existing applications that used Kotlin with Spring Boot. 

Then, I worked on making changes to the data streaming architecture, learning about Apache Kafka along the way. Collaborating with other teams, we targetted unnecesary data that were sent through Kafka topics for removal. After this clean-up, we were able to reduce storage requirements by 45%, saving a lot of resources.

I jumped unto a task to test the efficacy of UKG's job history application which condenses and organizes an employee's job history. I began by creating unit tests for all cases in the Jira ticket but I knew that it was missing out on many other possibilities. Knowing that UKG's HR department also uses UKG's products, I reached out to the HR team to ensure I accounted for all the possibilities that could arise. At the end, I was able to establish over 50 test cases that thoroughly tested the application.

I also participated in the internal UKG hackathon to create aggregations for Kibana logs, helping developers analyze errors. Finally, I pushed some of my code through production, gaining experience in Docker and Kubernetes.
