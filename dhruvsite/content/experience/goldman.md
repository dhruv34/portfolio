**Python, Javascript, React.js, ANTLR4**

* Automated the applied margin calculation process for syndicated loans within Investment Banking Engineering.
* Designed a domain specific language with ANTLR4 for parsing and communicating 100+ credit agreements.
* Developed an end-to-end application for the GS Digital Loan Agent using TypeScript, React, and Next.js.
* Led collaboration with the Investment Banking Operations team to design the loans pricing grid with Figma.

My intern project was to reinvent the existing pricing grid for syndicated loans. The pricing grid tells agents how the interest rate changes as certain key performance indicators (KPIs) are hit by the borrower. The existing pricing grid was depicted as an n-dimenstional matrix for n KPIs. As a result, for more complex credit agreements, the pricing grid would become too complex. 

In the first two weeks, I worked with my manager a loans agent to develop a rule-based representation of the pricing grid. Then, we used ANTLR4 to create a domain specific language to communicate the rules between systems. With the DSL in place, my task for the remaining of the summer was to create a read-only dashboard expressing the rules and another editable dashboard allowing agents to change the terms.

The read-only mode was fairly simple and I completed it in 2 weeks. However, the edit-mode took the remaining of the summer. Front-end programming was new to me so I had to spend time outside of work learning Javascript, ReactJS, and Goldman Sachs's internal UI Toolkit. These tools had to combined with our Python backend to create a complete product. I worked with agents and UX developers to create Figma mock-ups of the dashboards. The major challenge was that each time I had reached a near-finished product, we would come up with new requirements and edge cases. It wasn't until the second-to-last day of the internship that I made my last PR to fix the dashboard. Although I know that the pricing grid will require new changes and evolve over time, I was happy to see my progress through the internship and really enjoyed my experience!
