**PyTorch, Pandas, CUDA, Docker**

* Developed a 3D ResNet deep learning model to classify kidney tumor grades using CT scans.
* Utilized Georgia Techâ€™s PACE cluster and CUDA to train and deploy models across multiple GPU clusters.
* Implemented image segmentation on prostate cancer CT scans using OpenCV and Canny edge detection.
* Researched Docker containerization for medical imaging applications in collaboration with Emory professors.
