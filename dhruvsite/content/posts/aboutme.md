Hello! My name is Dhruv Adha. 

I recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelors in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Modeling/Simulation. 

I went to high school in Scottsdale, Arizona but now live in Dublin, OH.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, working on projects, and watching and playing soccer!
